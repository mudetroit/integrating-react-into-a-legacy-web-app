## What is next?

Now you have the opportunity to make your code better than it was before: <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

- Add linting, to avoid common errors and normalize style <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- "Let's face it you don't have tests for this <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" --> ![poop](img/poop-emoji.png)  <!-- .element: class="fragment poop-emoji" width="60" height="60" data-fragment-index="3" -->", well now you can (hint: Try Jest) 
- What about styles? <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->


## Lessons learned

- Start small and very isolated <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Work from the bottom of your DOM tree <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Keep working up the DOM tree handing over more responsibility <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Build your components specifically for the purpose at handing <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Then generalize them as the opportunity to reuse them occurs <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

- Slow and steady wins this race <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
