## Why React?

- Doesn't require ownership of the entire application <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Isolated concern (The V in MVC) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Easy to use within an existing system <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->


## Time for a quick caveat

Not necessarily the best pick for a green field application.

Worth noting that it still might be worth considering even then. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->


## Other possible libraries to consider here

- Preact <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
- Inferno <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
-  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" --> *insert any of the many libraries inspired by React*  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->

n.b. - Be aware of the trade offs you are making when choosing another library <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->
